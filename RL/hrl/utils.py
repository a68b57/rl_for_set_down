def get_soft_target_model_updates(target, source, tau):
	r"""Return list of target model update ops.

	These are soft target updates. Meaning that the target values are
	slowly adjusted, rather than directly copied over from the source
	model.

	The update is of the form:

	$W' \gets (1- \tau) W' + \tau W$ where $W'$ is the target weight
	and $W$ is the source weight.

	Parameters
	----------
	target: keras.models.Model
	  The target model. Should have same architecture as source model.
	source: keras.models.Model
	  The source model. Should have same architecture as target model.
	tau: float
	  The weight of the source weights to the target weights used
	  during update.

	Returns
	-------
	list(tf.Tensor)
	  List of tensor update ops.
	"""

def get_hard_target_model_updates(target, source):
	"""Return list of target model update ops.

	These are hard target updates. The source weights are copied
	directly to the target network.

	Parameters
	----------
	target: keras.models.Model
	  The target model. Should have same architecture as source model.
	source: keras.models.Model
	  The source model. Should have same architecture as target model.
